# Drawer component for Livewire

This is a very early prototype of soon-to-be package for livewire.

Are you tired of waiting for server roundtrip when opening modals/drawers that fetch content from server? 

> Me too.

This solution opens the drawer as soon as the user clicks on trigger button. The slide animation of drawer being opened takes around 300ms to complete, which will give the server roundtrip enough time to finish before animation is finished, resulting in a MUCH better UX.
